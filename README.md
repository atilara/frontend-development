# ðŸ§© Front-end Projects

## â„¹ About

A repository where I can keep all the front-end challenges that I've done. Most of these are challenges proposed by [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io), where you can download the necessary files to acomplish it.

## ðŸ›  Skills

The repositories linked here are used to train my habilities on the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Where I'm focusing my training on `stylization` and `responsiveness`. Each one of them will have a `desktop` and `mobile` versions.

## ðŸ—‚ Submodules

Allows you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. Used here to keep the challenges in a single repository in a organized way. The way it works can be read [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Each one of the repositories is hosted under MIT License.
